The concept 

It’s a simple locking tool that allows users to deposit their NFTs for a predetermined period of time (30,90,180, or 365 days), gamifies the conviction by implementing an experience system for conviciton, and optionally rewards the willpower of the lockers with an honorary non-transferrable ERC721 badge (Conviction Badge). 

This badge is tailored explicitly for each NFT and stores the address and the tokenID of the locked collection, and lock period — e.g., a conviction badge indicates Wassie 4574 locked for 6 months). 

This badge not only functions as a showcase for the owner’s belief in the project but also can be used by projects to give reputation-based rewards to their most devoted followers (little cosmetic airdrops, access to a close-circle community, a role in DAO governance, etc.)

VaultFactory is the hub for generating new vaults. Each project/individual can create public or gated vaults from the factory contract. Conviction badges are only rewarded for locking into a vault spun up from the factory contract.
