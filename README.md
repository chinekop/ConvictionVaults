It’s a simple locking tool that allows users to deposit their NFTs for a predetermined period of time (30,90,180, or 365 days) and rewards their conviction with an honorary non-transferrable ERC721 badge (Conviction Badge) which is tailored explicitly for the locked NFT (stores the address of the locked collection, tokenID, and lock period — e.g., Wassie 4574 locked for 6 months). 

This badge not only functions as a showcase for the owner’s belief in the project but also can be used by projects to give reputation-based rewards to their most devoted followers (little cosmetic airdrops, access to a close-circle community, a role in DAO governance, etc.).
