A Conviction Vault is a simple locking tool that allows users to deposit their NFTs for a predetermined period of time (30,90,180, or 365 days). The tool aims to help NFT communities lower token velocity and boost community cohesion with a reputaion-based locking mechanism that implements an experience system based on conviciton. 

The tool optionally rewards the willpower of the lockers with an honorary non-transferrable ERC721 badge (Conviction Badge). This badge is tailored explicitly for each NFT and each collection — e.g., a conviction badge might indicate the CoolCat 6529 is locked for 6 months). 

This badge not only functions as a showcase for the owner’s belief in the project but also can be used by projects to give reputation-based rewards to their most devoted followers (little cosmetic airdrops, access to a close-circle community, a role in DAO governance, etc.)
